| [bz-1457335 (follow up)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1457335) | Report via Slack from Panos that we don't apply the UA override for https. | Testing that the site works, [Pull request to enable https](https://github.com/mozilla/webcompat-addon/pull/36) |
| [webc-17008](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/17008) | Still unknown. `requestFullscreen` called on macOS, but not on Windows. Unfortunately, the stack is 94 calls large, so simply walking up the stack to find the spot where a difference between platforms occurs is not that easy. | Put aside for later today/later this week, so I can get some other issues off my plate. |
| [webc-20601](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/20601) | `IntersectionObserver` without explicit `root` seems to use the parent document as root in Firefox, but the frame document in Chrome. | ~~According to the spec, Firefox is right and Chrome is not, filed [crbug-902290](https://crbug.com/902290).~~ According to the spec, `intersectionRect` should be mapped to the document inside the iFrame, filed [bz-1505471](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505471) for that. |
| [webc-18554](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/18554) | Different rendering behavior for inline images with `width` set, so the image is visible in Chrome, but not visible in Firefox, so the `IntersectionObserver` never triggers the load. | Firefox behavior change tracked in [bz-1196668](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1196668), workaround suggested in the webcompat bug. |
| [webc-20049](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/20049) | Did some further diagnosis on Adam's request. Looks like a racey JS logic in their application, and less like a browser bug. | Provided more context via eMail and on GitHub. |
