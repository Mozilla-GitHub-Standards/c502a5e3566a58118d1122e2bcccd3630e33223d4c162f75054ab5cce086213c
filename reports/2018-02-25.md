| [webc-25052](https://webcompat.com/issues/25052) | Server configuration issue, but Chrome is perhaps handling it better. | Needscontact with suggested fix; also filed [bz-1527955](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527955). |
| [webc-25065](https://webcompat.com/issues/25065) | Site error, saying a bold webfont isn't bold. | Needscontact, suggested fixing their font-face rules appropriately. |
| [webc-25231](https://webcompat.com/issues/25231) | Turns out this is Chromium's bug. | Updated the issue with a comment to that effect. |
| [webc-26069](https://webcompat.com/issues/26069) | Worksforme. | Pinged Sergiu. |
| [webc-26009](https://webcompat.com/issues/26009) | Seems to be a meta-viewport issue. | Pinged Karl for insight. |
| [webc-25998](https://webcompat.com/issues/25998) | Flexbox input sizing issue. | Needscontact, suggested adding a max-width to the inputs, but filed [bz-1527982](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527982) just in case. |

| [webc-26078](https://webcompat.com/issues/26078) | No idea; my browsers' back button works fine, but maybe their in-site back button is busted. | Gave up because their site won't let me test it without oppressing me with endless captchas. |

| [webc-26122](https://webcompat.com/issues/26122) | Firefox redirects to "unknown protocol" error page, breaking UX where Chrome does not. | Needscontact suggesting an `intent://` URL instead, file [bz-1528305](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528305) to investigate matching Chrome. |
